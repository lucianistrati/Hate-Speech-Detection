# Hate Speech Detection

This is a repository for a project entitled "Hate Speech Detection" whose purpose is to find out whether a user spreads hate speech or not after seeing 100 tweets posted by him. Online hate speech is a type of speech that takes place online with the purpose of attacking a person or a group based on their race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, and/or gender. Online hate speech is not easily defined, but can be recognized by the degrading or dehumanizing function it serves.

# Observations about data

The dataset from the PAN 2021 Author Profilling competition is comprised of the profiles of 400 authors(200 english authors and 200 spanish authors) with 100 tweets assigned to each author. The profile of the author will be 1 or 0 depending on the fact that the authors spreads hate speech or not. On both languages the data is balanced with 100 authors that spread hate speech and 100 that don't.
